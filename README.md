# Beginner-Projects
This is a series of mini-project i worked on while studying the basics of Python. :)

The first projects are all about random numbers:
- Guess_number.py is a simple script to try to guess a number picked at random by the PC. The more tries you need to guess, the less points you get.
- Carto_sassa.py is a seven-way version of the classic Paper, Rock, Scissor game with "Characters" invented by me. First attempt at colours and lists/enumeratation.
- Dice_roller.py let's you select a type of dice and how many of them you want to roll and allow to roll with same parameters multiple times.
- Madlib/Madlib.py is a storyteller with the option to chose from a randomized story from the PC or a custom one, with words you are asked to enter and that fills paragraphs from LOTR, Harry Potter and Star Wars.
