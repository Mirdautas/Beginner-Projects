# Beginner-Projects
This is a series of mini-project i worked on while studying the basics of Python. :)

The first projects are all about random numbers:
- Guess_number.py is a simple script to try to guess the, you don't say, number picked at random by the PC.
- Carto_sassa.py is a seven-way version of the classic Paper, Rock, Scissor game with "Characters" invented by me. First attempt at colours and lists/enumeratation.
